<h2>Editing Features</h2>

<p>
While editing, Frescobaldi provides many ways to change and manipulate already entered music.
</p>

<h3><a name="rhythm" id="rhythm"></a>Rhythm</h3>

<p>
In the <em>LilyPond</em> » <em>Rhythm</em> menu there are many options to manipulate the
durations of a selected music fragment. You can double or halve the durations, add or remove dots,
remove scaling (the <code>*n/m</code> suffix) or remove all durations. <em>Make implicit</em> removes
durations that are equal to the previous note, and <em>Make explicit</em> adds the duration to every
note or chord, even if it has the same duration as the previous one.
</p>

<p>
You can also copy a rhythm from a selected piece of music. The rhythm is then copied to the clipboard.
To "paste" the rhythm to other music you must then select the target music. <em>Paste Rhythm</em> will then
apply the copied rhythm to the newly selected music. This is nice when you enter e.g. hymns that have
multiple voices that share the same rhythm. You can also use <em>Apply Rhythm...</em> to manually enter some
durations and apply them to a selected fragment of music.
If there are more notes than durations, the durations will be repeated.
</p>

<h3>Pitch</h3>

<p>
The <em>LilyPond</em> » <em>Pitch</em> menu has several commands to manipulate pitches of already entered music:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><em>Pitch Name Language</em></td>
<dd>
  <p>
  This command is very powerful:
  it translates pitch names in your document to a different LilyPond language.
  This is useful when you want to edit a work started by someone else, but are not
  accustomed to entering notes in e.g. dutch or italian names.
  </p>

  <p>
  The pitch translation function is quite accurate: it almost 100% correctly parses LilyPond input and finds
  all pitches, without altering e.g. markup, lyrics, strings or comments that also might contain words (like "do")
  that are also pitch names.
  It even warns you when quarter tones are used and the target languages does not have definitions
  for them. But just to be sure: run LilyPond after translating the pitches and carefully examine the document.
  If anything went wrong, press Ctrl+Z and try again.
  </p>
<dd>

<dt><em>Convert Relative to Absolute</em></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
  This command converts all notes in the document or selected fragment that are
  inside a \relative { ... } section to absolute pitches. It honors octave checks
  (see the LilyPond manual) but does not print warnings.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><em>Convert Absolute to Relative</em></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
  This command converts all notes in the selected music expression(s) to relative
  pitches, inserting a <code><b>\relative</b></code> command at the beginning of each selected music
  expression. A music expression is a piece of music enclosed in
  <code><b>&lt;&lt;&nbsp;...&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</b></code> or <code><b>{&nbsp;...&nbsp;}</b></code>.
  If no music is selected, all toplevel expressions that contain notes are
  made relative. Chordmode sections (music inside
  <code><b>\chordmode</b></code> or <code><b>\chords</b></code>) are not made relative.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><em>Transpose...</em></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
  This command transposes all music in the document or selected fragment. A dialog
  is displayed where you can enter two pitches, the "from" and the "to" pitch.
  Frescobaldi then computes the distance between the two pitches and transposes
  the music over the same distance. Both absolute and relative music can be
  transposed. Chordmode sections are transposed without changing the octave.
  </p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="lyrics" id="lyrics"></a>Lyrics</h3>

<p>
Frescobaldi can automatically place hyphens ' -- ' inside texts to make those texts
usable as lyrics. It can use hyphenation dictionaries of OpenOffice.org,
Scribus, KOffice, etc.
</p>

<p>
To use this feature you must first select the text you want to hyphenate. Then
choose <em>LilyPond</em> » <em>Lyrics</em> » <em>Hyphenation</em>
from the LilyPond menu or press Ctrl+L. In the dialog that appears, select the language.
Click OK or press Enter to have the hyphenation take place.
</p>

<p>
A small limitation is that word processor hyphenation dictionaries often don't
want to break a word right after the first letter (e.g. <code><b>a&nbsp;--&nbsp;men</b></code>), because that
does not look nice in word processor texts. So it might be possible that you
have to add some hyphens after the first letter of such lyrics.
</p>

<p>
There is also a command to remove hyphenation.
This can be useful if you have a stanza of lyrics
that you just want to display as a markup below the music.
Under <em>Settings</em> » <em>Configure Frescobaldi</em> » <em>Paths</em>
you can enter a <a href="configuring#settings-paths">list of directories</a> to search for hyphenation pattern files.
</p>

<h3><a name="cut-assign" id="cut-assign"></a>Cut and Assign</h3>

<p>
If you find that you want to use the same LilyPond commands or music fragment
more than once in multiple places in your document, but have already entered
them in some structure, there is a quick command to cut the fragment out and
put it as a toplevel variable assignment in your LilyPond document.
</p>

<p>
First select the exact text you want to store in a variable. Then choose
<em>Edit</em> » <em>Cut and Assign</em> (<strong>Ctrl+Shift+C</strong>)
and enter a LilyPond variable name. This identifier name may only contain letters.
Then click <em>Ok</em>. The selected fragment will be cut from its original
place and assigned to the specified variable. The assignment is placed just
before the current section in your document. The fragment will be replaced
with a reference to the variable.
</p>

<h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<p>
Frescobaldi uses the KatePart text editing component of KDE. So, in addition to the
shortcuts outlined below, you can also use the many keyboard shortcuts available in e.g.
Kate and KWrite.
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4">
